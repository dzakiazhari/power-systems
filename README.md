# Power Systems Projects & Experiments
This repository contains projects related to power systems. The projects are organized into three sub-directories: Autocad Substation Drawing, Electromagnetic Fields (Matlab), and Revit Installation Engineering Project.

## Autocad Substation Drawing
This sub-directory contains AutoCAD drawings of power system substations. The drawings include the layout of the substation, equipment placement, and electrical diagrams. These drawings are useful for planning and designing power systems.

## Electromagnetic Fields (Matlab)
This sub-directory contains projects related to the analysis and simulation of electromagnetic fields using MATLAB. The projects include three main experiments: 
1. Dipole Antenna Radiation
2. Transmission in Communication System
3. Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves Through the Atmosphere

## Revit Installation Engineering Project
This sub-directory contains Revit models of power system installations. The models include the placement of electrical equipment, cable routing, and electrical diagrams. Installation are categorized into electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and HVAC. These models are useful for planning and designing actual construction project and for coordinating with other building systems.
